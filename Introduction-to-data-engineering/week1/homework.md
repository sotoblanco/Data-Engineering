**1. Why did you join the course? Seriously, why?** 
Sometimes, this question is more challenging than it seems. 90% of you might answer, "I want to improve my data engineering skills," or "I want to land my dream job in data engineering." But often, that's not your real reason.

Take a moment to ask yourself *why* five times before you settle on an answer. Only then will you uncover your true motivation. Feel free to post whatever makes you comfortable, but keep in mind that you're more likely to achieve your goals if you dig deep and get to the root of your "why."

**Example:**
- Why did you join the course?  
  *Because I want to improve my data engineering skills.*
- Why do you want to improve your data engineering skills?  
  *Because I want to find a job in data engineering.*
- Why do you want to find a job in data engineering?  
  *Because it seems like a stable field...*

You get the idea. This is the first challenge I want you to reflect on and answer.

For your second challenge, I want you to **build your dream resume**—the one that, with your current knowledge, you believe will take you to where you want to be. Imagine a resume that would make you say, "This person is a genius!" Remember, this isn't your actual resume, but an ideal version—the one that would make it impossible for anyone to say no to you.

After you complete the course, we’ll revisit this dream resume and see how close you've come, and what has changed.
