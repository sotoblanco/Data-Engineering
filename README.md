# Data Engineering Study Group  
**For the Data Engineering Specialization by Deeplearning AI**

In this study group, we will follow the principles of *"learning how to learn"* by Barbara Oakley, along with other proven strategies for human-learning. Our goal is to help you develop strong data engineering and create an environment to help you to stay on track.

Each week, we will set specific goals and challenges to be completed. These challenges will be graded, and your scores will be displayed on a leaderboard, both here and in the Deeplearning AI community. This will allow you to track your consistency, showcase your skills, and demonstrate your abilities beyond just earning a certification.

### First week

Why did you join the course? Seriously, why? Sometimes, this question is more challenging than it seems. 90% of you might answer, "I want to improve my data engineering skills," or "I want to land my dream job in data engineering." But often, that's not your real reason.

Take a moment to ask yourself *why* five times before you settle on an answer. Only then will you uncover your true motivation. Feel free to post whatever makes you comfortable, but keep in mind that you're more likely to achieve your goals if you dig deep and get to the root of your "why."

**Example:**
- Why did you join the course?  
  *Because I want to improve my data engineering skills.*
- Why do you want to improve your data engineering skills?  
  *Because I want to find a job in data engineering.*
- Why do you want to find a job in data engineering?  
  *Because it seems like a stable field...*

You get the idea. This is the first challenge I want you to reflect on and answer.

For your second challenge, I want you to **build your dream resume**—the one that, with your current knowledge, you believe will take you to where you want to be. Imagine a resume that would make you say, "This person is a genius!" Remember, this isn't your actual resume, but an ideal version—the one that would make it impossible for anyone to say no to you.

After you complete the course, we’ll revisit this dream resume and see how close you've come, and what has changed.

### Weekly Learning Approach:

For each learning session we suggest based on the review of how human actually learn using 5 simple steps in each session, it might not feel as natural at the begining but this will help you to succeed and improve your internal process of learning.

1. **Review:** Skim through the week's content and related chapters from the *Data Engineering Fundamentals* book. Note any questions or doubts.
2. **Create a To-Do List:** Outline key topics or skills you want to focus on.
3. **Pomodoro Technique:** Use the Pomodoro method to organize your study time.
4. **Engage with the Material:** Take notes in your own words and apply analogies that connect the concepts to your existing knowledge or interests.
5. **Practical Application:** Consider how you would apply this knowledge to a real-world project.

### Study Group Structure & Leaderboard:

The study group session will have four major components

- **Weekly Interactive Form:** Complete a form with coding questions (similar to homework) using open-source datasets for hands-on practice. Share links to your public learning contributions and engage with peer questions.
- **GitHub Repository:** Maintain a central repository for your work, including solutions to the weekly coding exercises (many of which will involve real datasets).
- **Weekly Live Sessions:** Join virtual meetings (via Zoom or Google Meet) to discuss concepts and ask questions.
- **Capstone Project:** At the end of the course, you’ll work on an independent, open-ended project that integrates everything you've learned.

### Form Components:

- **5 Coding Questions** (required)
- **7 "Learning in Public" Links**
- **GitHub Repository Link**
- **Peer Question Answering** (bonus points)
